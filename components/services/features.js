X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light. In a health care setting, a machines sends are individual X-ray particles, called photons. These particles pass through the body. A computer or special film is used to record the images that are created.

Structures that are dense (such as bone) will block most of the X-ray particles, and will appear white. Metal and contrast media (special dye used to highlight areas of the body) will also appear white. Structures containing air will be black, and muscle, fat, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.


## **How the test is performed ?**

The test is performed in a radiology department by an X-ray technologist. The positioning of the patient, X-ray machine, and film depends on the type of study and area of interest. Multiple individual views may be requested.

Much like conventional photography, motion causes blurry images on radiographs, and thus, patients may be asked to hold their breath or not move during the brief exposure (about 1 second).


## **How to prepare for the test ?**

Prior to the examination, Inform the health care provider if you are pregnant, may be pregnant, If abdominal studies are planned and you have had a barium contrast study (such as a barium enema, upper GI series, or barium swallow) in the last 4 days, the test may be delayed until the contrast has fully passed.

You will remove all jewelery and wear a hospital gown during the X-ray examination because metal and certain clothing can obscure the images and require repeat studies.

Multislice CT scanning is a non-invasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions. MSCT provide amazing pictures of the human body including 3D images for accurate diagnosis.

    CT scans of internal organs, bones, soft tissue and blood vessels provide greater clarity and reveal more details than regular X-ray exams.
Using specialized equipment and expertise to create and interpret CT scans of the body, radiologists can more easily diagnose problems such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, appendicitis, trauma and musculoskeletal disorders.
    

## **CT scan may be helpful for the following**

-	Quickly identify injuries to the lungs, heart and vessels, liver, spleen, kidneys, bowel or other internal organs in cases of trauma.
-	Stage, plan and properly administer radiation treatments for tumors as well as monitor response to chemotherapy.
-	Measure bone mineral density for the detection of osteoporosis.
-	One of the best and fastest tools for studying the chest, abdomen and pelvis because it provides detailed, cross-sectional views of all types of tissue.
-	Invaluable in diagnosing and treating spinal problems and injuries to the hands, feet and other skeletal structures because it can clearly show even very small bones as well as surrounding tissues such as muscle and blood vessels preparation for Multislice CT Scan.
-	You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. You may be given a gown to wear during the procedure.
-	You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for several hours beforehand, especially if a contrast material will be used in your exam.
-	You should inform your physician of any medications you are taking and if you have any allergies. Also, inform your doctor of any recent illnesses or other medical conditions, and if you have a history of heart disease, asthma, diabetes, kidney disease or thyroid problems.
-	Women should always inform their physician and the CT technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant.

Digital Mammography is an X-Ray examination of breast tissue. The image produced is called Mammogram. A Mammogram can help detect problems with your breasts, such as cysts or cancer.
- Schedule the test for one week after your period when your breasts are less tender.
- Make sure you get your last mammogram, that lets the doctor compare the two.
- On the morning of your test, wash your breasts and underarms but don’t use deodorant, powder or perfume.
- Wear a top that you can remove easily.

## **During Your Test**
- You will need to undress from the waist up.
- The technologist will position your breast to get the best test results.
- Each of your breasts will be compressed. This helps to get the most complete X-ray image.
After Your Test
- More X-rays are sometimes needed. You’ll be called again if required.
- Breast Sonography may also be used to screen.
- Have Mammograms as often as your doctor recommends. Also be sure to do regular breast self-exams.

    detailedDescription: `# 
An ECG is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.
## **How the test is performed ?**
You will be asked to lie down. The health care provider will attach small patches called electrodes to those areas. It may be necessary to shave or clip some hair so the patches stick to the skin. The number of patches used may vary.
The patches are connected by wires to a machine that turns the heart’s electrical signals into wavy lines, which are often printed on paper. The doctor reviews the test results.
You will need to remain still during the procedure. The health care provider may also ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as the test is being done.

It is important to be relaxed and warm during an ECG recording because any movement, including shivering, can alter the results.

## **How to prepare for the test ?**

Make sure your health care provider knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some drugs can interfere with test results.
Do not exercise or drink cold water immediately before an ECG because these actions may cause false results
## **Why the test is performed ?**
An ECG is used to measure:
- Any damage to the heart
- How fast your heart is beating and whether it is beating normally.
- The effects of drugs or devices used to control the heart (such as a pacemaker).
- The size and position of your heart chambers.


An ECG is often the first test done to determine whether a person has heart disease. Your doctor may order this test if:
- You have chest pain or palpitations.
- You are scheduled for surgery.
- You have had heart problems in the past.
- You have a strong history of heart disease in the family.

Color Doppler is detection and finding motion of blood flow using a Color map that is incorporated standard format B-mode image. It detects and interrogated large scale of region and blood flow, typically blue and red. It can also detect whether the blood moving toward or way from the transducer. It has estimated frequency shift at each point at which motion is detected within an interrogated region, thus yielding information on direction of motion and velocity. 

Shades of color blue and red used to reflect relative velocity of blood flow. All stationary objects showing in gray scale as a B-mode imaging. The benefit of color Doppler is that information on the direction and relative velocity of blood flow can be obtained. Color Doppler is limited by its dependence on the relative angle of the transducer to the blood flow.

## **Benefits of the Color Doppler**

1.	Provides a visual overview of flow within the vessel or heart.
2.	Rapid identification of vessels, valves and turbulent flow.
3.	Assess flow direction and velocity.
4.	Quantify volume and percent vascularity.
5.	Identify area of stenosis or thrombosis.
6.	Find small vessels such as mouse coronary arteries, femoral and accurate arteries.
7.	Evaluate blood flow after a stroke or other conditions causing impaired blood flow.
8.	Monitor blood flow to major organs such as heart, kidney, liver pancreas, carotid, Abdominal aorta, and others.

## **What is a Doppler ultrasound ?**

A Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive test that can be used to estimate your blood flow through blood vessels by bouncing high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) off circulating red blood cells. A Doppler ultrasound may help diagnose many conditions, including:
- Blood clots
- Poorly functioning valves in your leg veins, which can cause blood or other fluids to pool in your legs (Venous Insufficiency)
- Heart valve defects and congenital heart disease
- A blocked artery (Arterial Occlusion)
- Decreased blood circulation into your legs (Peripheral Artery Disease)
- Bulging arteries (Aneurysms)
- Narrowing of an artery, such as in your neck (Carotid Artery Stenosis)
 
A Doppler ultrasound can estimate how fast blood flows by measuring the rate of change in its pitch (frequency). During a Doppler ultrasound, a technician trained in ultrasound imaging (sonographer) presses a small hand-held device (transducer), about the size of a bar of soap, against your skin over the area of your body being examined, moving from one area to another as necessary.
This test may be done as an alternative to more invasive procedures, such as arteriography and venography, which involve injecting dye into the blood vessels so that they show up clearly on X-ray images.
A Doppler ultrasound test may also help your doctor check for injuries to your arteries or to monitor certain treatments to your veins and arteries.

  Computed tomography of the heart or cardiac CT is routinely performed to gain knowledge about cardiac or coronary anatomy, to detect or diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD), to evaluate patency of coronary artery bypass grafts or implanted coronary stents or to evaluate volumetry and cardiac function (including ejection fraction). 
![CT4](/images/ct4.png)
![CT5](/images/ct5.png)

Cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) for Calcium Scoring uses special x-ray equipment to produce pictures of the coronary arteries to determine if they are blocked or narrowed by the buildup of plaque – an indicator for atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease (CAD). The information obtained can help evaluate whether you are at increased risk for heart attack.
